# Stock-Portfolio-optimization
This project focuses on portfolio optimization using Monte Carlo simulation. Monte Carlo methods provide a powerful way to model uncertainty and assess risk by generating thousands of potential portfolio outcomes. This project demonstrates how to construct and evaluate an optimal portfolio by simulating different asset allocations, analyzing returns, and quantifying risk under varying market conditions


# Project Structure
Stock_data.csv - Contains historical price data of 30 Indian stocks over a 5-year period, extracted using the yfinance API. This dataset serves as the foundation for portfolio construction and optimization.
optimization.ipynb – A Jupyter Notebook implementing the complete workflow: data extraction from yfinance, exploratory data analysis and visualization, preprocessing of stock returns, portfolio analysis, and Monte Carlo–based portfolio optimization to identify risk-return efficient portfolios.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
